# End-to-End-ML-Systems
🌿 End-to-End Machine Learning Systems – Plant Disease Classification

This repository contains my work for the End-to-End Machine Learning Systems project, where the goal is to build a complete ML pipeline for plant disease classification using the PlantVillage dataset.

The project progresses from classical machine learning baselines to deep learning models, emphasizing real-world ML practices such as data handling, model evaluation, and performance analysis.

📌 Project Objective

Build a robust image classification system to identify plant diseases

Understand the transition from traditional ML models to deep learning

Learn how transfer learning improves performance on large image datasets

Evaluate models using appropriate metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices

🧪** Weekly Breakdown**
✅ **Week 1: Data Understanding & Exploration**

Explored the PlantVillage dataset

Understood directory structure and class distribution

Visualized sample images

Discussed challenges of image-based datasets

✅ **Week 2: Classical Machine Learning Baselines**

Converted images into feature vectors

Built shallow baselines using:

Dummy Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Established a performance baseline to compare deep learning models against

⚠️** Week 3: CNN Transfer Learning (Partial Completion)
**
In Week 3, the focus was on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning.

✔️ Completed:

Used pretrained CNN models (e.g., MobileNetV2)

Froze base model layers to leverage learned features

Added custom classification layers

Trained and evaluated the model on the PlantVillage dataset

Analyzed training performance and confusion matrix

this is what I achieved

❌ Not Completed:

Full end-to-end deployment pipeline

Advanced optimization and experimentation due to time and resource constraints

Despite partial completion, this week provided strong practical understanding of how transfer learning significantly improves performance compared to classical ML models.
